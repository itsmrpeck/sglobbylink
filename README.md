# SGLobbyLink v0.1 - by Mr Peck



# How to use:

Create or join a Skullgirls lobby on Steam.
Run the program. It copies your 'Join Game' link to your clipboard.
Paste the link in Discord!

NOTE: The first time you run the program, it asks for your Steam ID and saves it to steam_id.txt. Once it has saved your Steam ID, it can instantly get your lobby link without having to ask you for anything.



# Troubleshooting:

Things that will cause this program to not work:

- Your Steam profile is private
- You entered an incorrect Steam ID (try deleting steam_id.txt and trying again)
- Steam is down
- You forgot to create the lobby before running the program
- I messed up somehow. This is the first time I've coded web stuff...



# External libraries used:

- libcurl (cURL)
- json.h
